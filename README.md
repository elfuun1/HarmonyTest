# HarmonyTest

This is a fork of kenny2892's Flower Dancing mod.
I forked it because I couldn't get harmony to work and I have no idea what I was doing wrong.
This mod effectively does nothing other than send a message to SMAPI's console saying everything is working as intended, if it's working as intended.
